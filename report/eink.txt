PI Dutta's team has developed a bluetooth enabled e-ink display. It provides an output for the data gathered by other projects from PI Dutta's team. It is built off of a nucleum module and Pervasive Displays' TCMP441 e-ink display. Data is sent over Bluetooth Low Energy to the e-ink display through the nucleum over a 10 pin header. It accepts x, y, scale, and text inputs. The device is also capable of displaying qr codes. All of this is powered by either a 5v barrel jack and wall adapter or a pair of AA batteries. Because of the nature of an e-ink display, it is able to run for very long periods of time on just those batteries.

Future Work involves integrating this display with other projects developed by PI Dutta's team. Specifically, it will be used to display occupancy values of rooms using data from sensor deployments.
